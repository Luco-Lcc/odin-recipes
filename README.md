# odin-recipes
!First project for The Odin Project!

The two main goals of this project is to put into practice the learnings related to basics of HTML development and Git.

By creating a website of recipes, it is expected to have a main page with links to other pages that will have different recipes. It will be possible to apply the concepts of links, lists, headings, paragraphs, images and so on.

Also, it will be necessary to commit often. That's a good opportunity to apply this concept, creating concise and meaningful commit messages.
